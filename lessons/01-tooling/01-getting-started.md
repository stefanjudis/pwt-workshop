# Get started with `@playwright/test` (`PWT`)

Playwright started as an automation library used for web scraping and browser automation similar to Puppeteer. But it quickly evolved to a full test runner and framework that's built to scale.

## Install Playwright Test

The best way to get started is the default `init` command.

```bash
$ npm init playwright@latest
```

Confirm that the installation succeeded by running your first PWT test.

```
$ npx playwright test

Running 6 tests using 5 workers
  6 passed (3.6s)

To open last HTML report run:

  npx playwright show-report
```
Congratulations! You just ran your first PWT tests. But you didn't see any browsers popping up. Use the `--headed` flag to see your automation in action.

```
$ npx playwright test --headed
```

> **Note**
> By default Playwright test runs in full fledged parallel mode and kicks off multiple parallel processes to run your tests. This functionality can be tweaked via the `workers` and `fullyParallel` in the `playwright.config.[js|ts]`, on a test level or via the command line. [Find more information in this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG0YePSS5iA&list=PLMZDRUOi3a8NtMq3PUS5iJc2pee38rurc&index=11).

## `playwright.config.[ts|js]` â€” all these options! ðŸ¤¯

Inspect the provided `playwright.config.[ts|js]` to familiarize yourself with all the possibilities. The config file is very well documented, so it's worth to poke around.

During the workshop we'll look at:

- timeouts
- parallelism
- traces
- devices
- and much more.

Let's get started and give you [a headstart by recording your first test](./02-recording-tests.md)!
