# Playwright Test Workshop

Playwrigh started as an automation library but evolved to a full test runner and framework.
## The goal

This workshop will teach you Playwright Test essentials. Examples will use a demo shop to explain concepts. To follow along with the example, use a demo shop example (`https://danube-web.shop/`), **but feel free to test and implement functionality for your production sites.**

## Action plan

This repository includes lessons covering Playwright Test's core functionality. Work through it at your own pace. I'll cover lessons every few minutes live and will answer questions on the way. Have fun!

## Agenda

- `30min` — Playwright Intro presentation
- `30min` — Playwright tooling
- `60min` — Playwright's essential concepts
- `The rest` — Write your tests!!!
