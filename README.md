# Playwright Test Workshop

`playwright` started as an automation library similar to `puppeteer` but quickly evolved to a full test runner and framework with `@playwright/test`.
## The goal

This workshop teaches you Playwright Test (PWT) essentials to get started in the world of end-to-end testing.

Supportive materials and tasks are all included in the `/lessons` directory. Lessons build on top of each other and are hands-on — **work through them at your own pace**. I'll answer questions on the way and might do the exercises, too.

To follow along, all the examples will test [an online example webshop called "Danube"](https://danube-web.shop/). But feel free to test and implement functionality on other websites. **Start testing your local development or production sites!**

## Action plan

This repository includes lessons covering Playwright Test's core functionality. Work through it at your own pace. I'll cover lessons every few minutes live and will answer questions on the way. Have fun!

## Agenda
