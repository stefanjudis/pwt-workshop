# Playwright Test Workshop

Playwrigh started as an automation library but evolved to a full test runner and framework.
## The goal

This workshop will teach you Playwright Test essentials. Examples will use a demo shop to explain concepts. To follow along with the example, use a demo shop example (`https://danube-web.shop/`), but feel free to test and implement functionality for your production sites.

## Action plan

This example repository includes lessen covering most of Playwright's core functionality. Work through it at your own pace. I'll cover lessons every few minutes live and will answer questions on the way.

## Agenda

- `30min` — Playwright Intro presentation
- `30min` — Playwright tooling
- `30min` — Playwright's important concepts (actionability and web-first assertions)
- `rest` — Hands-on Playwright exercises
